3. Having worked 5 years at an unloved job, I realized that it can not continue. Because I think that without deal of the life is hard to self-realization and feel satisfaction from life. After work out with myself realizing that I have always had an analytical mind and technical subjects I was given the easiest decided to do programming. I chose the direction of front end development because by my nature I am visual and it is important for me to see what I do. And for me it is important to quickly get the result of the work and programming gives it-wrote the code and by pressing the button already get feedback. And it is cool).
I want to create what people need and what else you can want from work!? The feeling that you bring benefit to society and your work is not in vain. And of course MONEY:)
4. Skills: HTML, CSS, Less, Javascript.
